Goal: When the Cursor agent creates or edits a file, automatically open that file in a new editor tab.

Required Behavior

When the Cursor agent creates a file → Open it automatically in a new tab.

When the Cursor agent edits a file that is not already open → Open it automatically in a new tab.

If the file is already open, do not open another tab.

Strict Exclusions

Do not auto-open when:

Change was made by Composer or npm

composer install/update/dump-autoload/require/...
npm install/update/ci/...

File is in vendor/

vendor/**

Change is from git operations

merge, rebase, pull, checkout, apply, git diff

File is not a code file, except README

Allowed file extensions (auto-open)
✅ Code files
.php, .ts, .js, .jsx, .tsx, .vue,
.py, .rb, .go, .cs, .rs, .c, .cpp, .css, .json

✅ README-style files
.md, .mdx, .mdc

Disallowed extensions (never open)
.env, .lock, .log, .sql, .txt
yarn.lock, package-lock.json
images, binaries, fonts

Additional Behavior

Do not auto-open:

scaffolding/migrations

build output

generated cache

**Laravel-specific exclusions:**
- `storage/framework/views/` (compiled Blade templates)
- `storage/` directory (all Laravel storage files)
- `bootstrap/cache/` (Laravel bootstrap cache)

Only open 1 tab per file per change.

If multiple files are modified:

Only open files created or edited by Cursor agent

🧠 Short version (summary for the model)

Auto-open any new or modified code file (including .css, .json like package.json and composer.json) or README file when the change comes from Cursor agent.
Do not open files generated by Composer, inside vendor/, from git operations, or non-code files except README (.md, .mdx, .mdc). Lock files (yarn.lock, package-lock.json) remain excluded.

**Laravel:** Never open files in `storage/` directory (especially `storage/framework/views/` compiled Blade templates). Only open source files in `resources/views/`. Browser refreshes must not trigger file opening.

**Package Managers & Build Scripts:** Aggressively detect when Composer, npm, yarn, or build tools are running by monitoring early indicators:
- `package.json`, `composer.json` (read at operation start)
- Lock files (`composer.lock`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) - change early
- `vendor/autoload.php`, `vendor/composer/installed.json` (composer early files)
- `node_modules/.package-lock.json` (npm metadata)
- Build output directories and manifests

Suppress all auto-open operations for 30 seconds (extended with each activity) to avoid opening framework-generated, installed, or compiled files. Early detection ensures suppression activates BEFORE files are created.

Test: This file was edited to test the auto-open extension functionality.
Test 2: Testing after extension update and VS Code restart.
Test 3: Testing with logging enabled - checking if file edit triggers auto-open.
Test 4: Testing after output channel improvements - should see detailed logs.
Test 5: Current test run - checking if .md file edits trigger auto-open.
Test 6: Testing with vscode.open command - should be more reliable for edited files.
Test 7: Testing with preserveFocus and viewColumn options - should ensure files become visible.
